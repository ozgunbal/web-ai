 * Policy as DATA (spec section 3.3) — easy to show on a slide, easy to reason

 *
 * DESIGN DECISION (not literal from spec): `PolicyRule.condition` is a zod
 * `z.string()` (human-readable, per spec 3.2) but spec 3.3's rules embed real
 * thresholds ("amount <= 1000"). A string can't be evaluated safely. We keep
 * `condition` as pure display text on the validated data, and pair each rule
 * with an executable predicate here, keyed by rule id. This reconciles "policy
 * is data" with "policy needs real threshold logic" without smuggling
 * executable code into the zod-validated PolicyRule itself.
